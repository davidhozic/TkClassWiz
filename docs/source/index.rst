TkClassWizard (|version|)
=========================================================
TkClassWizard - define objects graphically based on class annotations.
The library allows users to create abstract "ObjectInfo" objects based on the class's parameters, which
can later be converted to real Python objects and vice versa.

While all classes with annotations can be defined with TkClassWizard, there is also support
for some other data types that classes can accept as parameter:

- Other classes with annotations (if no annotation exists, they can be manually defined through TkClassWizard)
- list
- Iterable
- tuple
- int
- float
- string
